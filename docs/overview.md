## Best Practices by Use Case

### **Team Discovery**
‚úÖ **Do**:
- Start with product/component name searches
- Try multiple naming variations (hyphens, underscores)
- Cross-reference group membership with JIRA activity
- Look for ownership patterns in issues

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Assume exact group name matches
- Rely solely on group membership for expertise assessment
- Ignore JIRA activity patterns for team boundaries

### **Individual Assessment**
‚úÖ **Do**:
- Use comprehensive member profiles for overview
- Search individual's JIRA activity for details
- Check multiple projects for complete picture
- Note time patterns in activity

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Judge expertise solely on JIRA issue count
- Ignore inactive periods (may be working on other projects)
- Assume recent activity represents total capability

### **Project Analysis**
‚úÖ **Do**:
- Use project-specific searches with filters
- Look for patterns in issue ownership and assignment
- Check multiple time periods for trends
- Cross-reference with group memberships

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Rely on single data source
- Ignore historical context
- Assume current activity represents project importance

## Troubleshooting Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Group Not Found**
**Problem**: `mcp_rover_rover_group` returns "Group not found"

**Solutions**:
1. Try naming variations: `product-qe`, `product-team`, `product-infra`
2. Search JIRA for team members first: `mcp_jira-mcp-snowflake_list_jira_issues`
3. Look for email patterns in existing groups
4. Check for acronyms or abbreviations

**Example**: 
- `cnv` ‚Üí Not found
- `container-native-virtualization` ‚Üí Not found  
- **Solution**: Found team structure through JIRA project analysis

### **Scenario 2: Limited JIRA Activity**
**Problem**: Member profile shows no JIRA activity but person is known to be active

**Solutions**:
1. Try different search terms (name variations, email)
2. Search multiple projects they might contribute to
3. Check if they work on projects not in Snowflake data
4. Look for older activity with broader date ranges

**Example**:
- Direct name search yields no results
- Try email prefix or variations
- Check group membership for project hints

### **Scenario 3: Conflicting Information**
**Problem**: Rover groups and JIRA activity don't align

**Solutions**:
1. Remember Rover is real-time, JIRA is historical
2. Check dates of JIRA activity vs. current group membership
3. People may have changed roles or projects
4. Cross-reference multiple data sources

### **Scenario 4: Too Much Data**
**Problem**: Search returns overwhelming number of results

**Solutions**:
1. Add project filters to narrow scope
2. Use time-based filtering for recent activity
3. Focus on specific issue types or priorities
4. Use status filters to focus on active work

## Advanced Use Case Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Cross-Product Integration**
When working on projects that span multiple products:
1. Map all related groups and projects
2. Identify shared contributors
3. Look for integration-specific teams (like INTEROP)
4. Check for cross-project issue references

### **Pattern 2: Historical Analysis**
For understanding how teams evolved:
1. Use date-based JIRA searches across multiple periods
2. Track membership changes in groups over time
3. Look for project transitions and ownership changes
4. Identify skill migration patterns

### **Pattern 3: Compliance & Auditing**
For understanding access and responsibilities:
1. Map group memberships to project access
2. Check group approval types and ownership
3. Verify project activity matches group purpose
4. Identify potential access inconsistencies

### **Pattern 4: Strategic Planning**
For organizational planning and resource allocation:
1. Analyze workload distribution across teams
2. Identify collaboration bottlenecks
3. Map expertise coverage and gaps
4. Plan for succession and knowledge transfer

## Integration Workflows

### **Rover + JIRA Integration Pattern**
```
1. Start with Rover for current team structure
2. Use JIRA for historical context and activity
3. Cross-reference for complete picture
4. Validate findings across both sources
```

### **Project-First vs. People-First Approaches**
**Project-First**: Start with JIRA project analysis, then find responsible teams
**People-First**: Start with group membership, then analyze their project involvement

### **Continuous Monitoring Pattern**
```
1. Set up regular queries for key teams/projects
2. Track changes in membership and activity
3. Monitor for new groups or project emergence
4. Maintain awareness of organizational changes
