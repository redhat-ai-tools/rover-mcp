## üöÄ How to Use These Integrated Queries

### In Cursor Environment (Recommended):
1. **Natural Language**: Ask these questions directly to Claude in Cursor
2. **Automatic Integration**: Claude intelligently combines data from both MCP servers
3. **Rich Analysis**: Get comprehensive insights combining team structure + real project data
4. **Professional Output**: Receive management-ready reports and analysis

### MCP Server Auto-Selection:
Claude automatically determines which MCP servers to use based on your query:
- **Rover queries** ‚Üí Uses local rover MCP server
- **JIRA queries** ‚Üí Uses JIRA Snowflake MCP server  
- **Integrated queries** ‚Üí Uses both servers and correlates data

### Command Line Testing:
```bash
# Test rover server
python demo_analytical_showcase.py

# Test individual rover tools
python -c "
import asyncio
from mcp_server import rover_group
result = asyncio.run(rover_group('sp-ai-support-chatbot'))
print(result)
"

# JIRA server testing happens automatically through Claude in Cursor
```

### Example Integrated Query Flow:
```
You: "Give me dhshah's profile including both rover groups AND actual JIRA work"

Claude: 
1. Calls rover MCP: get_comprehensive_member_profile('dhshah')
2. Calls JIRA MCP: list_jira_issues(search_text='dhshah')  
3. Correlates the data to show group access + real project involvement
4. Provides unified analysis with actionable insights
```

|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| üè¢ **Rover Structure** | 1, 2, 3 | Rover only | Team organization, access control |
| üìä **JIRA Projects** | 4, 5, 6 | JIRA only | Project visibility, issue tracking |
| ü§ù **Basic Integration** | 7, 8, 9, 10 | Both servers | Real team-project correlation |
| üî¨ **Advanced Analysis** | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 | Both + complex logic | Strategic intelligence, executive insights |

### **Complexity Progression:**
- **üü¢ Beginner (1-6)**: Single server queries for specific data
- **üü° Intermediate (7-10)**: Cross-server correlation and basic integration  
- **üî¥ Advanced (11-15)**: Multi-server analysis with strategic insights

## üí° Pro Tips for Integrated Analysis

1. **üü¢ Start Simple**: Begin with queries 1-6 to understand each MCP server's capabilities
2. **üü° Progress to Integration**: Try queries 7-10 to see the power of combined data
3. **üî¥ Advanced Insights**: Use queries 11-15 for strategic analysis and executive reporting
4. **üîÑ Natural Language**: Ask conversationally - Claude handles all MCP server coordination
5. **üìä Real Data Advantage**: Rover provides team structure, JIRA provides actual work - combined they show the complete picture
6. **üîç Follow-up Deep Dives**: After getting overview results, ask for specific member or project details
7. **‚ö° Auto-Detection**: Claude automatically determines which servers to use based on your question
8. **üéØ Context Matters**: Mention both "team structure" and "project work" to trigger integrated analysis

### **Example Escalation Pattern:**
```
1. Start: "Who's in the AI chatbot team?" (Rover only)
2. Expand: "What projects are they working on?" (JIRA only)  
3. Integrate: "Show me their team structure AND current project work" (Both servers)
4. Analyze: "Give me a complete team effectiveness assessment" (Advanced integration)
```

These 15 queries demonstrate the **revolutionary power** of combining organizational intelligence with real project data - transforming how you understand and manage teams!
